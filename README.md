# LineageButton
Button interface compatible with Lineage OS.


Use shell commands to check the values of gpio pins.  If a pin assigned to our button is noticed to be changed, than use system commands to change the value of another gpio pin to turn on an LED.  The LED indicates the system has reconized the button press and that the system is changing volume.
